###### About the game:      

SpaceGame is a fun little project I worked on for a quarter in high school. It is a game, where you control a little spaceship with your mouse and shoot down rocks before it destroys Earth. There is powerups and lasers and bosses. Try to advance in levels and stay alive! Don't let the rocks pass you, and kill the big patrick boss. I hope you have fun!
